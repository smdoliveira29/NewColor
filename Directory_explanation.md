1) Forbidden colors
These colors are based on the opponent-process theory, which proposes that human color vision operates through three opposing channels: red vs. green, blue vs. yellow, and black vs. white.
According to this theory, it is impossible to simultaneously perceive both colors within an opponent pair, like reddish green or yellowish blue, because the neural signals for these opposing colors would cancel each other out.
But is that so? No, we can see these colors, but it takes practice. Using binocular vision, we can have one eye see red, and the other see green. Your eyes will then fight for dominance, and you will see a changing gradient between the two. You can try to focus on the edge, but that part will become solid of one or the other color. It will take some time at looking at it, but eventually they will mix. So far, it is somewhat undocumented, but the only way people can describe it is just reddish-green. This idea works with all opposing colors.
3) Chimerical colors
Chimerical colors are perceived by tricking the brain through afterimages and combining them with specific backgrounds.
They are a result of cone cell fatigue, where prolonged exposure to a color desensitizes the cones, causing an afterimage of the opponent color.
Examples of chimerical colors:
Stygian colors: Darker-than-black, saturated colors, like "stygian blue" (achieved by viewing a blue afterimage against a black background).
Self-luminous colors: Colors that are brighter than white, like "self-luminous red" (viewing a red afterimage against a white background).
Hyperbolic colors: Colors that are more than 100% saturated, like "hyperbolic orange" (viewing an orange afterimage against an orange background). 
5) Impossible colors
These colors exist within color spaces defined by mathematical models but do not correspond to any physically realizable light wavelengths.
They are theoretical colors that can be calculated but not seen, such as "hyper-green," which would be greener than any real green.
Although these colors are mathematically impossible to create, we can still see them. This is where Olo comes in. It is created by stimulating only green cone cells.
