1) Forbidden colors
These colors are based on the opponent-process theory, which proposes that human color vision operates through three opposing channels: red vs. green, blue vs. yellow, and black vs. white.
According to this theory, it is impossible to simultaneously perceive both colors within an opponent pair, like reddish green or yellowish blue, because the neural signals for these opposing colors would cancel each other out.
But is that so? No, we can see these colors, but it takes practice. Using binocular vision, we can have one eye see red, and the other see green. Your eyes will then fight for dominance, and you will see a changing gradient between the two. You can try to focus on the edge but that part will become solid of one or the other color. It will take some time at looking at it, but eventually they will mix. So far it is somewhat undocumented, but the only way people can describe it is just reddish-green. This idea works with all opposing colors.
