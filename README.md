# NewColor
This is a devlog of an attempt to create new colors using vr or perhaps your phone.

Colors are seen by mixing the red, green, and blue cone cells in your eyes. A simple way to non-invasively manipulate
them individually is simple fatigue. It's kind of like if you stare at a white TV screen, there will be a strange
rectangle in your vision. It is completely natural and harmless, so if we exploit this we can create colors that are 
impossible to see otherwise. Olo is a new color created by scientist by only targeting green cone cells. Green cone cells 
are always activated by all colors (to some degree), so if we only activate those cone cells, we see a color that we have 
never seen before. There are already methods to see super-saturated, darker than black and brighter than white colors 
using fatigue, but no one has been able to make Olo with this method. That is what my end goal is. Plus, I want to make 
the new colors we have already made less like an afterimage and more like something we can focus on directly. Using vr 
applications to fill peripheral vision, and exploiting binocular vision, many new colors would be possible.
